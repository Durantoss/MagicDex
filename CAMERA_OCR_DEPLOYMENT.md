## 🌐 Netlify Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
Since your repository is connected to Netlify, the deployment should trigger automatically when you push to the main branch.

### Manual Deployment Steps (if needed)
1. **Login to Netlify Dashboard**
2. **Find Your Site** (MagicDex project)
3. **Trigger Deploy** if it hasn't started automatically
4. **Monitor Build Logs** for any issues

### Build Configuration
Your `netlify.toml` is properly configured:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## 📱 Testing After Deployment

### Camera Functionality Requirements
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera access only works on secure connections
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (recent versions)
- **Camera Permission**: Users must grant camera access

### How to Test
1. **Navigate to deployed site**
2. **Look for blue "Scan Card" button** in header
3. **Click to open scanner modal**
4. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted
5. **Position MTG card** within frame guide
6. **Click "Scan Card"** to process

### Expected Behavior
- Camera feed displays in modal
- Scan button processes image with OCR
- Card names are extracted and displayed
- Toast notifications provide feedback
- Error handling for denied permissions

## 🎯 Key Features Live

### Camera Interface
- ✅ Live video preview
- ✅ Scan guide overlay
- ✅ Manual capture button
- ✅ Loading states during processing

### OCR Processing
- ✅ Text recognition from images

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Ensure HTTPS and modern browser
2. **Permissions denied**: User must manually grant camera access
