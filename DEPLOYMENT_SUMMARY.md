## ⚠️ **Pending Manual Steps**

### **Database Migration Deployment**
The database migration needs to be applied manually due to password requirements:

1. **Link Supabase Project** (currently waiting for password input):
   ```bash
   npx supabase link --project-ref reeijsdzozdvnbkbngid
   # Enter your Supabase database password when prompted
   ```

2. **Apply Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

3. **Alternative: Manual SQL Execution**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Execute the contents of `supabase/migrations/20240125000000_add_decks_tables.sql`

### **Database Migration Contents**
The migration includes:
- `decks` table with user ownership and metadata
- `deck_cards` table with card details and quantities
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic timestamp triggers
